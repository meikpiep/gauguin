# Development

Gauguin uses, depends, builds on

* OS: Android
* language: Kotlin
* build system: Gradle
* UI: Material via XML (switching to Compose is a long term thing)

## Gradle modules

There are two modules to separate the core logic from Android specific and/or UI specific code:

* gauguin-core: Plain Kotlin module without any Android or ui related dependencies.
* gauguin-app: Android app module using gauguin-core, Android SDK, AndroidX, Material Design
Components.

## Build flags

These flags are passed to Gradle and are interpreted by custom Kotlin code included in Gradle Kotlin
DSL. To set this flag via Gradle wrapper, use e.g. for flag `buildserver`

    ./gradlew build -Pbuildserver

All flags default to false and may be activated to switch them to `true`. You can combine multiple
flags like this:

    ./gradlew build -Pbuildserver -Pscreenshot

### Flag buildserver

The build flag `buildserver` lets some tasks run long running stuff beeing used in CI builds only.
This triggers the following

| Value | Behaviour                                                                |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| false | Deactivate Sonar as whole.                                               |
| true  | Activate Sonar, let Sonar depend on Android linter results (task `lint`) |

### Screenshot tests

`screenshot` needs to be set to activate screenshot tests. Without this flag, no screenshot test
will be run as they need quite some time.
