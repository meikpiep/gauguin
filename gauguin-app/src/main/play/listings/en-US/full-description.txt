Gauguin is a Sudoku-like game where you solve grids via calculation and logic.

You can use it to relax or to solve difficult grids to your opinion.

In classic mode, you solve a 9x9 grid by typing a value from 1 to 9 in each cell such as
- Each row and column contains each digit exactly once.
- Each cage meets its given mathematical problem. E.g. a group of cells labeled with '5+' must be filled such that the sum of all digits is 5.

Via game options, you may alter the game to solve other digits, smaller or greater grids, hiding the operators.


<b>Slick and modern UI</b>

- No switching of 'pencil mode' or such thing is  needed: To set a value of a cell, just use short-tap to alter a possible value and long-tap for a known value.
- 'Fast Finishing Mode' enables to fill cell with exactly one pencil mark rapidly.
- Uses colors from the painting 'The Siesta' from Paul Gauguin (guess where the app's name comes from...)


<b>Game options</b>

- grid sizes: 3x3 to 11x11 with classic 9x9
- includes rectangular grids, e.g. 7x9
- operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- digits (1 to n, prime numbers, fibonacci sequence etc.)
- difficulty (covering a incresing number of game variants)
- usage of single cells
- show or hide operators


<b>Things still to be done</b>

- not all grid variants get calculated in a reasonable time (e.g. a 4x8 grid will likely need more time than your battery wants to give)
- onboarding is missing a tutorial
- not all game variants have been supplied with difficulty ratings yet
